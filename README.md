# Assignment: CRUD API

## Description

Your task is to implement simple CRUD API using in-memory database underneath.

## Technical requirements

- Task can be implemented on Javascript or Typescript

- Only `nodemon`, `dotenv`, `cross-env`, `typescript`, `ts-node`, `eslint` and its plugins, `webpack-cli`, `webpack` and its plugins, `prettier`, `uuid`, `@types/*` as well as libraries used for testing are allowed

- Use 18 LTS version of Node.js

- Prefer asynchronous API whenever possible

## Implementation details

1. Implemented endpoint `api/users`:

   - **GET** `api/users` is used to get all persons

     - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and all users records

   - **GET** `api/users/${userId}`

     - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and and record with `id === userId` if it exists

     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)

     - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist

   - **POST** `api/users` is used to create record about new user and store it in database

     - Server should answer with `status code` **201** and newly created record

     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if request `body` does not contain **required** fields

   - **PUT** `api/users/{userId}` is used to update existing user

     - Server should answer with` status code` **200** and updated record

     - Server should answer with` status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)

     - Server should answer with` status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist

   - **DELETE** `api/users/${userId}` is used to delete existing user from database

     - Server should answer with `status code` **204** if the record is found and deleted

     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)

     - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist

2. Users are stored as `objects` that have following properties:

   - `id` — unique identifier (`string`, `uuid`) generated on server side

   - `username` — user's name (`string`, **required**)

   - `age` — user's age (`number`, **required**)

   - `hobbies` — user's hobbies (`array` of `strings` or empty `array`, **required**)

3. Requests to non-existing endpoints (e.g. `some-non/existing/resource`) should be handled (server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding human-friendly message)

4. Errors on the server side that occur during the processing of a request should be handled and processed correctly (server should answer with `status code` **500** and corresponding human-friendly message)

5. Value of `port` on which application is running should be stored in `.env` file

6. There should be 2 modes of running application (**development** and **production**):

   - The application is run in development mode using `nodemon` (there is a `npm` script `start:dev`)

   - The application is run in production mode (there is a `npm` script `start:prod` that starts the build process and then runs the bundled file)
